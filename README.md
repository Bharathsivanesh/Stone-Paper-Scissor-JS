# Project Description
This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Stone-Paper-Scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides an engaging interface where players can select their move and compete against a computer opponent. The game tracks the score for both the player and the computer, updates the number of moves left, and displays results after each round. At the end of the game, players receive a final outcome and can restart the game easily.
