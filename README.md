# Project Description
This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Stone-Paper-Scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides an engaging interface where players can select their move and compete against a computer opponent. The game tracks the score for both the player and the computer, updates the number of moves left, and displays results after each round. At the end of the game, players receive a final outcome and can restart the game easily.

# Code Explanation
->HTML: Defines the structure of the game with a container for the game area, buttons for selecting moves, and sections for displaying results and scores.
->CSS: (Assuming index.css contains styles for the game) Styles the game elements, ensuring a visually appealing interface.
->JavaScript: Manages the game logic. It includes:
->func(data): Handles player moves, generates computer moves, updates scores, and displays results.
->resett(): Resets the game state, including scores, moves left, and visibility of elements for restarting the game.
